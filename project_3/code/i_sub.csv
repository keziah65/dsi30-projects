11,"Shares of Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) jumped 7.85% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the streaming giant posted mixed financial earnings.

Financials: Netflix reported earnings per share of $3.20, which was better than expected. But the company’s revenue of $7.97 billion was below estimates.

Subscribers: The company lost about 1 million subscribers in the quarter, which was good news because Netflix was expected to lose 1.8 million in the quarter.

Currency Problems: With 60% of the revenue coming from international markets, the company sees currency issues as a “significant headwind” for the third quarter. Netflix suffered a $339 million foreign currency impact in the second quarter.

Layoffs: Netflix revealed that it accumulated about $70 million in severance costs in the quarter.

Advertising: In an update regarding Netflix’s new ad-supported subscription plan, the company is testing it out in a handful of markets and it will likely evolve over time.

Password Sharing: Netflix also wants to cut down on password sharing. The company said it is currently testing two different strategies in Latin America aimed at reducing password sharing.

Big Picture: Investors were so happy with Netflix’s results that other streaming stocks ticked up late Tuesday as well. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) jumped 2.10% and Warner Bros Discovery (Nasdaq: WBD) went up 1.75%.

Final Thoughts: Shares of Netflix are down 66% this year. Could the stock truly rebound in a post-pandemic world?

I’m only on episode 3 of season 1 (don’t remember anything really from watching previously) so forgive me if i’m asking too soon, but i’m wondering if this is just me misunderstanding or incorrect subtitles or just an oddity of the series.

There are people trying to overthrow Ezekiel and the way he leads the Process because the first ever murder occurred in the Offshore. Makes sense. What doesn’t make sense to me is that they keep saying this guy, Matheus i think his name is, wants to have an ‘easier’ Process.

Is this a translation error or something? Because surely if there was the first ever murder in a place, you would want to intensify the “Process” to get in there rather than make it easier for people to get in? So it seems odd that there are people fighting against Ezekiel to make the Process easier rather than more rigorous.

Maybe it’s just me misunderstanding or something that will be cleared up later or an error of translation, but I am very confused so any light to be shed would be greatly appreciated!

81,"So first of all I think that Netflix used to be the most sexy thing for people who enjoy movies and binge series. Before we had streaming we had illegal websites with shitty quality and a bunch of ads. Not really good for the industry and bad user experience. It was the best alternative to buying the movie online for the DVD price or actually buying the DVD and having a huge collection of which half of them would be watched once or twice.

First time I got Netflix it was worth the money. Access to series with subtitles, great movies selection and great quality. I thought that it can only get better from here.

Fast forward a few years and I turn on the app and I have came to a few realization:  
\-The streaming market sucks because in order to watch what I want I have to make several subscriptions  or miss out. 

\-Library is region locked and fairly small. Not a lot of movies from the 90s or 00s. Not a lot of classic blockbuster movies available.

\-Netflix originals are mediocre. Some good but I have a feeling that they are making content for the sake of making content.

\-I love Vox and their explained series but their quality has been dropping and it feels like a celebrity is reading out a wikipedia article with visual effects. Documentaries in general are becoming pretty lackluster since they feel very superficial and do not cover the topic completely.  Ken Burns documentary on prohibition and the Vietnam war documentary were pretty solid tho. 

\-Series being produced are still released on a weekly basis which I find very frustrating since this is not TV where I should have to wait. 2022 bro we binge nowadays. I understand why companies do this for the life cycle and franchising etc. however I still do not like it.

Tldr: I feel like Netflix has become lazy and not worth the money anymore. The reason why I subscribed in the first place have become obsolete. Netflix has become lazy and the quality of new releases are mediocre or bad. Small library and low effort content.",netflix,Why I am cancelling my subscription,submission

In episode 2 there is a video call and on the device screen you can see this:

*Processing img 0uaiyldtplc91...*

The video call is made with Notepad! Ignoring the fact that they are using Windows 10 in 2036, it was as easy as not showing the taskbar, or at least if you put it, I don't know, use Skype. At least they have blurred the icons and the date/time.

Okay. An oversight. No problem.

We continue with the episode and now, another similar scene:

This is no longer an oversight. They are making a video call with Paint, the computer does not have an Internet connection, and the date/time is literally covered up. Not deactivated or removed (Windows does not leave that space), but in post-production someone has decided that the best solution was to paint over it.

Holy \*\*\*\*...

This is the level of production today? Take a famous name, throw a script on a table, gather a group of people and wait to see what comes out? I understand that the actors do the best they can with what they are given, but little is saved from the rest, if not nothing.

So I just finished this show and while it wasn’t bad I cannot get over the fact that the furious five didn’t show up one single time. 

It’s silly. But It’s also annoying. And mid tier. That’s my take. 

But- WHERE are the furious five? I mean seriously how is it remotely believable that this dude is the dragon warrior and not one single person comes to his aid. I get it. People are jerks and it’s not hard to believe a whole country would hate a celebrity for screwing up especially when it’s all word of mouth. The game of telephone gets pretty nasty. 

But do his best friends seriously not care about him at all? Like how does something this drastic not go noticed by them. Did they just say “meh screw him”

Now- speaking from personal experience I have had an instance where someone set me up, the game of telephone happened, lies were spread about me throughout the school and all of my friends immediately dropped me without question. 

But that’s only ever happened once and we were all children. 

Also Po is literally the savior of China and the furious five aren’t a-hole children lmao.

My honest idea here is that Netflix didn’t feel like paying for the voice actors and got lazy with the writing. They easily could have been like “oh they’re out of the country on vacation” but nAH let’s just totally sweep three movies, a tv show and special animated shorts under the rug.

406,"Netflix depicts bullying in the way that bullies get to do whatever they want without repercussions. Everyone laughs at the victim.

If the victim ever decides to fight back against the bullying, or if they even THINK the victim fought back, the VICTIM WHO STOOD UP TO BULLYING always gets in trouble.

Stranger Things shows El being arrested for fighting back. Resident Evil shows the father of the daughter who bullied Billie threatening to have her sent to jail when she didn't even do it. All Of Us Are Dead is LITERALLY about victims of bullying becoming ZOMBIES and attacking everyone. The bullies should be the zombies, since zombies are desensitized villains!

Why can't Netflix writers depict the PROPER way to fight against bullying? You get bullied, you immediately stand up for yourself. You do not back down. You fight until you win, in whatever way makes sense in that situation. You fight for the one battle and all battles to come, to paraphrase Ender Wiggin.

Netflix writes shows where bullies get away with their behavior, and if a victim fights back, the bully can report it and punish their victim yet again. They need to write shows where bullies immediately face consequences, so bullies who watch these shows think twice before bullying again.",netflix,I hate how Netflix depicts bullying,submission

I watched a show that was kinda cute and I was browsing Reddit during a few episodes. After the last episode I went back to rewatch some episodes and it’s not anywhere, even though it was recommended before I started it. I searched how to find recently viewed shows and you kinda have to go thru back channels to find something you literally just finished watching. Wouldn’t it be helpful to have a category, even if at the bottom of your list, of your watch list? There’s been sometimes that I’ve fallen asleep during a binge of a series and I liked the first few episodes but it played while I was asleep and wanted to watch it only to find I have to go on the non mobile version of Netflix and find parental controls and recently watched. 

I figured this out after a search of how to find recently viewed. The mobile version is basically their app and you can’t see the website info. I can’t be the only one to have this frustrating experience.

681,"Mean Girls is a fun trip down memory lane. I remember watching it with my freshman roommates in 2004. As for TTMR, this was a first watch, and I'm amazed that I've never taken the time to watch it when it first came out (though granted, I was 13, and my friends and I were more into American Pie lol).

Watching the two movies back to back makes me see the parallels of feeling that sense of ""starstruck""-ness when we're in close contact with someone who has... more. Regina George was beautiful, glamorous, and rich. Dickie was handsome, fun, charismatic, and (also) rich. There is something so fascinating about being next to people like them: you're envious, but you want to be them. And when they ""choose"" you to be their friend, there's something so invalidating about that, sad as it is :/ 

At least, I definitely relate to feeling that way growing up: wishing I had ""more"" - prettier, more popular, more money, whatever. Even though I'm 36 now and have grown into myself a bit more, I think I still struggle with it sometimes. It makes me think about things like self-esteem, confidence, identity, etc.

I love both movies' descriptions of obsession: For Cady, it was when she admitted, *""I spent about 80% of my time talking about Regina, and the other 20% of the time, I was praying for someone else to bring her up so I could talk about her.""* For Tom, we see shots of his face full of yearning as he watches Dickie's large-than-life partying ways, and the casual way Dickie's just like, ""Oh I'm gonna take a boat around to pick out a house... then this winter I'm going on a skiing trip with my rich friends... let's get you a suit, I know the best store in Italy."" It's all just so casually glamorous! And when you're dissatisfied with your own life, it's easy to really want that life.

Not sure where I'm going with this. Just thankful that I got to watch two great movies this past week, and I guess they're making me a bit contemplative (esp TTMR). It also reminds me of A Separate Peace from high school. It's all a bit nostalgic.",netflix,"Thank you Netflix, for putting on The Talented Mr. Ripley and Mean Girls!",submission

Basically, for years now we've had four profiles, one for each member of the family: A, B, C, and D.

Randomly a couple weeks ago, C and D disappeared. We cleared the cache, logged out and logged back in, and gave it time to sort itself out, but nope, C and D never returned.

This past week, to start from scratch, I made a new profile, E. A few days later, A disappeared, and we're left with B and E.

I contacted Netflix customer service chat and they basically said they can't restore profiles and that we should just make sure we're careful with who has access to our account or lock profiles so they can't be modified just because someone has our login. I told them that that's definitely not the issue here given the people who have access to the account, and they just invited me to go through some account security measures with them.

This feels like a really stupid tech error, and I've seen others with the same problem. There's no way that metadata(?? not sure if that's the term) isn't in the cloud at Netflix somewhere.

I just finished the last episode and absolutely was dismayed by the fact that Duffer Bros let Max live, like I don’t hate Max or anything but you have to imagine the world of pain that shes going to be in IF she wakes up from her coma and also blind on top of the numerous bone and movement based diseases that she’s bound to contract. She’s also bound to have a huge relapse and flare-up from her PTSD and other mental disorders so this girl is going to be at constant war with her own body and mind way much more then she was when just mourning Billy. 

She was a very important character and was brave and honorable by provoking Vecna, but they should’ve given her the dignity of dying by her own sacrifice in a way of honor.

958,"I've watched Daybreak now three times, and I am still left amazed by the outstanding performance of the cast. One character who I think suffers from the 'Padme' effect is Sam, not sure if it's her lack of lines, that the writers just focused on all the other characters or the fact they want to make her character ambiguous so the great reveal at the end is a bigger shock.

&amp;#x200B;

Sam to me has always stood out as a character juggling many masks, the person who everyone wants her to be vs the person she wants to be.

&amp;#x200B;

But I just finished watching episode 8, I know that this is a controversial episode (as many dismiss it as being counterproductive to the plot) but the actress who plays Sam really gets to demonstrate her talent and the character herself gets to evolve. At the end of the episode, she is getting ready for Homecoming and after a long day with Josh with some very hurtful things said to each other I think her mask has finally started to slip. Shame and sorrow start pouring through and she truly hates herself, it has been mentioned a few times in past episodes that her status as Homecoming queen was never her intention, Principal Burr put her up to that, she even tells Josh she can't face the hate she gets online. In the episode she learns about sunflowers polymorphic properties, and tells Josh that they themselves need to be polymorphic, they need to be more than who they are, and I think this is deliberate writing to backup the idea that Sam is always wearing a mask and we never know who she is.

&amp;#x200B;

She then starts putting on her makeup, a literal mask, wiping the tears from her face, and by the time she's done, she crowns herself and, no longer faces her trauma, instead you can see it in her eyes that she has become the Homecoming queen. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was such a powerful scene, I had to go back and rewatch it, the music and the way it faded out to the credits with the sunflowers.

&amp;#x200B;

The show's theme is infectious, but not annoyingly so. It gets you excited for what adventures Cuphead and Mugman will go on.

Turn Up The Charm is nothing short of spectacular. Chalice's vocals really carry the song though. Grey Griffin, who is Chalice's VA, really gave it her all here.

1484,"Even as a lifelong gamer, I acknowledge that a lot of stories in games are very action-oriented. But the story of Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the most truly MATURE stories around.

By that, I mean that yes, while there is some pretty rough shit that happens in the world, it doesn’t rely on obsessive cursing or nudity to drive a compelling narrative.

It deals with different heirs competing for the throne, and the armies they rally around them, shaky alliances between nations, the ruthlessness of war and those nobles who use other men to wage it, it shows the power of the Church and the political ramifications of religion… honestly, while it’s a lofty goal to hope for something on the level of the vaunted Game of Thrones (at least earlier seasons), there’s definitely a WHOLE lot to work with. And the game’s story certainly doesn’t pull any punches, with implication of some pretty brutal stuff that occurs off screen.

Personally, I would specifically seek out the team that did the animations for the PSP remake. It has a REALLY interesting, atmospheric and very dark art-style. It’s one that could probably lend itself well to any amount of vulgarity, blood, or even nudity that Netflix might want to inject, without compromising the world itself. Because it is indeed a pretty gnarly world in Final Fantasy Tactics.

There’s also a BIT of magic, but not so much that it overshadows the ACTUAL events at hand. In fact, you could damn near remove any sort of “magic” entirely, and still be left with mostly the same story.

Just felt like throwing this out there. I could really see something like this making a solid 3-4 seasons, and that’s assuming you mostly follow mostly content from the game.",netflix,"You know what would make a dope series? One based on Final Fantasy Tactics, aka “War of the Lions”",submission

1657,"I just finished watching Stranger Things S4 and I have to say that it was by far the worst season. The start was (EP 1-4) we’re very promising it genuinely made me excited and got me wanting more. Then it just went absolutely downhill. 

Firstly the build up of Vecna. This was seriously the most anticlimactic villain vs hero story. I felt like they tried way to hard to build Vecna up, they gave us a 15 minute monologue of his background and most of us knew from the start that “001” was Vencna. Els battle with Vecna was just so boring it’s like we all know what was going to happen and then he just escapes. At this point I think the direction of the show is so obvious. Us as the viewers in season 1-2 had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next. The suspense felt so good. Now we literally know what they will do next it’s actually infuriating. 

Secondly, the gang being split up. This was very frustrating and at times I couldn’t even watch as some scenes were so boring. In my opinion the whole Russian/Alaska thing was totally unnecessary and a massive waste of time. The connections and back stories of new characters apart from “Vecna“ where not established well e.g Enzo and Yuri. It would have been nice to see a little bit of there back story so the audience could have established a connection. The build up of them fighting the creatures in the prison didn’t meat up with the expedition and the end result as the fight in the prison seemed very rushed and underwhelming. Not to mention, three days later they pop back up in Hawkins. No scenes of Hopper, Joyce, Enzo, Yuri and Murray embracing, telling each-other the plan/what’s next. Basically leaving it up to the kids to solve everything.

Max, where to start with this one. The character change was refreshing to see. Her being Vecnas last source was very interesting and I actually enjoyed it. But then they had to absolutely butcher it by killing her, then bring her back to life by Els powers which we never knew she had or even was capable of possessing. Max became so underwhelming and completely useless in the last episode it was actually such a waste.

1662,"I really enjoyed the ending of Stranger Things season 4. I'm sure a lot of people did. I think this is the strongest season by far. I've seen a few complaints about how no 'major' characters died (unless you count Max but that's a technicality). Personally, I feel like this amps up the stakes for next season. It's the last one. All bets are off. No one is safe and, if they die, they're not being brought back. Also Eddie deserved better, I loved him.

This is all speculation obviously but as a lot of my friends haven't seen the end of Season 4, I just wanted to yeet my thoughts onto the internet and this seemed like an ideal place to do it. Spoiler tag added just in case anything I say below gives away information from Season 4.

* Vecna has Max's mind/consciousness held hostage in the upside down. If there's some kind of a time skip, it'll be to a point where he uses her mind as leverage to lure the gang back into the upside down where he's strongest.
* Will's going to die. This will be a full circle moment for him. He was the first taken, the first saved, and he's going to realise that he's the lingering connection between the upside down and our world. It's likely that he has some of the dust in him and that's why he can feel Vecna still after all this time. I can see him sacrificing himself by pushing Vecna into the upside down and going with him so there's nothing left of it in our world. He's the key to breaking the connection.
* Before this happens, Will is going to have a discussion with Mike where Mike will tell him that he's the true heart of their group. He's the reason that they all came together. To save him. Will is going to tell Mike that he'll always be grateful they saved him, and now it's time for him to do the same for them.
* Eleven will either die or lose her powers while sealing the gates to the upside down forever. If she dies, I think that Hopper and Joyce will be shown in an epilogue of sorts with a new baby that they maybe name after her (possibly her real name of Jane). If she survives but loses her powers, I think she'll be shown in a much, much later epilogue with a son with Mike, and he'll be called Will.
* Johnathon Byers will either die trying to save Will, sacrifice himself in Will's place, or he'll live (possibly be injured trying to protect or stop Will from leaving) and he'll have had a heart-to-heart between brothers. In that discussion, Will is going to tell Johnathon that he needs to live to his fullest potential, to promise him that he won't waste his life, and that he'll take care of Joyce for him.
* If Nancy and Johnathon break up, she won't date Steve. I'd love for them to get together, but I could see Nancy deciding that she doesn't need her fate to be tied to her love life anymore and she wants to be independent. Steve, I hope, will be supportive of this and eventually move on. That, or they'll reunite years later when they've both grown up a little more.
* Dustin and Susie will be in an epilogue as adults which is reminiscent of IT chapter two. Dustin will be a writer, possibly writing novels based on Dungeons and Dragons (maybe within that universe as a ghost writer), but also documenting the life he led with his friends. Susie will still be working with computers. Part of what Dustin writes will be along the lines of 'Ever since that day, the gates to the upside down have remained closed, but we keep watching for a sign, and we're ready if Vecna ever returns.' Susie has computer systems that are rigged to check for anything like activity that would relate to the upside down. Susie asks Dustin if he's done on the book and if he'll publish. Dustin says no, and thinks no one would ever buy the story, because even by fantasy standards it's crazy. They leave the house, the camera pans to one of her computers. We hear a car engine start outside and then an alert appears on the computer screen; activity detected.
* The final scenes of the epilogue will be the now adult kids, Hopper, Joyce, etc. all meeting up at a memorial to honour their friends, like they do every year. The camera will cut to the facility from the first episode. Abandoned and in ruins. Yet, as it slowly creeps in towards a wall, a crack begins to form. A hint that this isn't over, and that the door is open for a sequel if they ever come back to it.
* If there is a sequel, it's possible that Will has been corrupted by the upside down and becomes the new Vecna, but I'd rather they just left it open ended with and didn't try to do an 'IT chapter two' series.

So, yeah, those are just a few of my thoughts on what could happen in the future and on the way season four concluded. I don't know if any of it will happen, but I'm interested in your thoughts and theories for the next season because, again, none of my friends have finished watching because they're the worst.

Its like Netflix just said 'oh everybody likes Korean people now, lets just remake shit but with Koreans. The characters are not fleshed out enough, not likeable or relatable like in the original. It lacks emotional depth and in my opinion, everything that was interesting in the original, the way they didn't even care to change the names and the character motives makes it just feel really cheap. I had expected more of a follow up with new locations and characters and shit with it all still being based around a heist, not just a reskin, especially because I really fucken loved the original series.

Now when the next season of either shows come out or a sequel to them I'm not to sure but I would love to see more of this type of thing being shown, maybe it's because of the genre it is in which gives it more of a mystery? Regardless the way ist telling the story by splitting off the actual TV show into seperate shows conjoining to one is something I have not seen before and if I did well it didn't do it the way they done it

We were watching the finale of Stranger Things and the compression artifacts were horrible. In sections it was like watching a 1990's web video even though I have over 900 Mb down and 800 Mb up. I wanted to report it but couldn't find the option. We tried other shows and even a couple episodes of Stranger Things seasons 1 and 2 and they all looked great. 

I got on Netflix support chat and was basically told that the ""Report a Problem"" feature was my only option but when I told the agent I didn't have that option they basically gave up and asked if I could use a different device.

I remember reading an article a couple years (?) back where Netflix said they pre-encode all the various bit-rate streams so all your client does is stream the corresponding version for your connection. So I guess maybe they could have just been forcing lower bitrates because of how overloaded the service was but I've been unable to corroborate with friends that they had the same experience.",netflix,"Is There No ""Report a Problem"" on AppleTV?",submission

Playlists: 
Curated by Netflix etc and user created. Playlist of favourite episodes of a TV show or “best horror films”, Top 100 IMDB etc 

Appreciate the user experience here could be iffy depending how it is was implemented as different regions have different content but I think there’s a few clever ways this could be handled

Shuffle: let me pick a tv series and just play me an episode - I don’t care which one. Something like Always Sunny or Rick &amp; Morty for example would be prefect examples where shuffle would be good. Go one step further and allow users to shuffle the whole
Series or a specific season.

The writing seems like they ditched all the original writers and hired fans of the show to write it.

I don’t get what the whole visiting Russia thing was about. I think it could have been a cool idea but the execution was lacking.

Also I don’t like the stoner drug guys that they threw in. Stoner humor is not funny to start with and this is a particularly bad example of it.

Also the bad guy is not that scary, I just laugh every time I see him. He looks like squidward.

One thing I like is how Ele had to team up with the lab guys to get her powers back, it was a good twist and made sense for the plot. Also, the Russian defector character who becomes friends with Hopper in prison is cool and a good addition. 

I wouldn’t be so harsh if this show didn’t have such a strong history. In the past I think they’ve done really well at keeping the new seasons consistent with the original and still adding interesting elements. I think the hiatus with covid really screwed with them. They had like 3 years in between and it’s hard to make up for that, especially when the main characters are all adolescents.

1754,"ps: i love stranger things and this time they really messed up. 

loved volume 1, especially the whole henry is 001 twist in ep7, that was just epic

i have no problem that the episode ended with the upside down reality flowing into the human occupied reality. in fact that was highkey what i really wanted to see. but this episode could've been so much better. 

before i mention my problems with the plot, i'd like to point out things that were awesome:

1) the cinematography. the shots in the desert in ep8 and the ones in the haunted houses were beautiful  
2) master of puppets, where the episode peaked imo  
3) the whole molotov cocktail followed by nancy shooting with the shotgun sequence  
4) really underappreciated by the fight sequence between the basketball guy and lucas, great choreography and realism as lucas would naturally lose  
5) the vfx were \*chef's kiss\*

now the criticisms:

1) although joyce saving hopper from the demodog was great, the swordfight between hopper and the demogorgon was painful to watch. just let murray have his moment for god's sake.

2) the monologue btwn mike and 11 was unnecessarily long, and cringey

3) why were steve, nancy and robin not mourning eddie's death? 

4) the steve, nancy and john love triangle was unnecessary 

5) last but not least, instead of teasing that max may or may not be alive, they should've just killed her off in front of 11, lucas and jason. vecna felt soft in this episode compared to vol1 where he was menacing. imo that would've lived up to his ruthless nature that we saw in earlier episodes. as i mentioned, the duffer brothers can come up with something far better and it was probably netflix who are too afraid to let go of a major character.

also, if max isn't alive then why did the gate open in the first place? major plot hole",netflix,[SPOILERS] STRANGER THINGS S4 Vol 2 finale was disappointing,submission

1964,"Hey guys,

I know this sounds stupid and I will definitely get some rude responses although I want to point out that I, first of all, hate having to clearify it to avoid any hostile backslashes in this modern society in the first place.

There is nothing wrong with people having their own definitions of sexuality and stuff and I do not care.

But (and there is always the ""but"") I cannot watch recent Netflix series through because of the amount of gay, bi, non-binary and other stuff going on for minutes straight in front of the camera. I skipped half an hour at least with ""Daybreak"", now with ""Another Life"", I have to skip again.

And there are a couple of things that are really disturbing imho:

\- Why do I have to watch half a season(!) at least before any of this has to be shown?  I would avoid that but Netflix has no comment section and none of the series have warnings about it.

\- Why are series like that not always 18+? Kids should not be exposed to that if they do not want to (adults as well btw).

\- Missing declaration. ""Usual"" movies and series are known for straight stuff and I do not want to be forced into watching stuff I for myself find disturbing to watch. I mean turn it around: Gay people know what they are up to when watching ""Dirty Dancing"" or ""Pretty Woman"". And some may don't like the or are disturbed by explicit 'straight' scenes as well. But although I totally not care what said people do when they are at home, where I do not have to watch, I totally do when they force me to look at that and that is straight f\*cked up.

For me, this is no way to loosen people's minds and opinions about LGBTQ but putting them into very uncomfortable situations and ruin some movie evenings for good.

Because when a series is described as ""exciting"" and ""thrilling"" with genres of ""Mystery"", ""Sci-Fi"" and ""Thriller"", I don't expect the nice guy to hook up the non-binary medic or the swashbuckler to have a threesome with the hot engineer and a shy Russian in a messed up bi-something whatever. Just saying!

Am I the only one thinking this way?",netflix,Amount of LGBTQ in Netflix series,submission

2000," A lot of people who went into the show, came in with their own expectation. These are the same people who expect quality, but when a creator takes something of quality and replicates it, the people change what they want to something different, when the creator tries to match that, the people complain about quality.

Instead of just appreciating quality, regardless of how many times they replicate it. These are the same people who will watch Godfather or the LOtR 50 times. They also complain about the saturation of the zombie genre and super heroes e.t.c

That's why, never try to make people happy, people are never happy.

Anyways, I actually liked it because, they took Money Heist, tried to remove the aspects of the show that were in my opinion, poorly executed and in general, gave a better motive for the Professor and the gang. Over the just 'i wanna rob cause big bank bad'.

My favorite reason for liking the Korean version, they made Berlin so much cooler and with a sympathetic back story. This is one of my main reason's for liking the Korean version, Berlin is a hardass in both iteration and one of the most alpha character personality there is. But in the Spanish version, they character assassinated him by making him a pervert. Like i get he's terminally ill, but they had to make him a rapist pervert? In this one, he's just as much of a hardass, who prioritizes the mission over his humanity and going from his backstory, i can at least understand how he came to be who he is and he can actually think without his dick. You can't hold it in until you get out?

Another bonus, in the Korean iteration, at least in the last episode. His co-workers actually respect him and dareisay don't hate him and want to kill him first opportunity, i ESPECIALLY like his dynamic with Tokyo. He got the credit for theory crafting how to handle Denver and Moscow stepping out and Tokyo alley ooped it with the way she worked over Youngmin. They work well together in this show and it just makes everything better. They don't have to be best of friends, that doesn't mean they have to hate each others guts as some sort of good vs evil representation, that's just cheesy. He even defers leadership with a good point how it shouldn't be abdicated after a single mistake, whether or not he's genuine, i do think he's genuine in his desire to complete the objective, that's why he's here, for the money. Not to get his dick wet, not to create unnecessary drama, although his pining for leadership is still there. I expect many more acts of tension between the two, but i hope they at least form a sense of understanding between each other and find a way for both to get what they want, instead of some cheesy good vs evil BS.

Another thing, Berlin and Professors relationship in the Spanish version was just...weird. So they are close prior to the heist and i really appreciate how he believes in the Professor, but the Professor had to get petty by incriminating Berlin and overall, i don't get why Professor and Berlin are close (I am only at the end of season 2), they just have weird chemistry and Tokyo has far better chemistry with Professor than Berlin. At least before the heist, which brings me to my main two points.

Professor and Tokyo, i am sorry but i just like the backstory behind their characters in the Korean version over their Spanish counterparts, in this they actually feel like Vigilantes, bordering on the side of good, over just anti heroes. Tokyo genuinely trusts and sees Professor as a mentor. Seeing Tokyo in the spanish version acting like some highschool romance character, then have BPD with how she feels about the professor, from threatening him, believing in him as a guardian angel after he rescues her, losing faith in him, it's all over the place. And i am only at the end of season 2.

Professors back story is also IMO a bit better, since its more involving of the world around them, from what i can gather, he's responsible for the foundation of the joint economy that is taking advantage of the poor people and North Koreans who come in with star sprinkled eyes. So in a way, he's making up for his actions and that just gives it a Holywood esque title, over the realistic 'bank sucks, lets rob them'. At least for me it makes it easier for me to root for the Professor.

Finally, they play better at the premise of turning the Hostages against each other, either through greed, history, class based differences e.t.c in the Korean show they sorta address the class based divide that prevents it from being a Kidnappers vs Hostage situation, showing even in the worst of times, racism and prejudice will prevail. I hope if there's a season 2, they show more instances of the North Korean hostages working with the Kidnappers and even joining them.",netflix,Money Heist Korea is better than the original,submission

* Gabby's Dollhouse
* Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, &amp; Dawn
* Fairly Odd Parents
* My Little Pony: Make Your Mark
* Lego Ninjago
* Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse

2075,"I don't typically put much stock into films like this one. They're good for a light-hearted laugh with mild drama at best, and a perfectly bow-wrapped ending. *Usually*. When I started Senior Year, it was more of a 'nothing else to watch' mood than one looking for a few cheap laughs, but figured it would help pass the time anyways - and it did. 

What I didn't get was WHY THE FRICK DIDN'T THE FILM ADDRESS THE FACT THAT TIFFANY WAS THE WHOLE REASON STEPHANIE WAS IN THE FREAKING COMA. In the beginning, we see a jealous Tiffany talk to the catchers who then later and purposely keep their arms down instead of catching Stephanie. This is what knocked the cheer captain the f-out in the first place. Towards the end, Tiffany approaches Stephanie with a genuine (?) apology for everything she did, BUT she never owns up to her part of Stephanie's coma. In addition, since she *did* play a part in it - shouldn't she had felt guilty for essentially killing off her classmate? Twenty-years is a long coma, but considering most people in the U.S. can't afford to keep a comatose victim on life support with round o'clock care in a hospital for a few months (I know twenty years was affordable in 'movie logic') - at any point Stephanie could have and would have had the plugs keeping her alive pulled. In addition, Tiffany even admitted to having 'taken the perfect life' Stephanie had always wanted, which could have been her coping with her guilt, BUT even if she got help and moved past it, when Stephanie woke up, why didn't Tiffany try to help her? Instead, she resorted right back to her petty ass shit.

Tiffany felt like her character was wasted and had she been more fleshed out, would have led to a better and stronger ending between her and Stephanie as well as the 'be yourself' type of message they were really forcing. Even tossing in a nod to the audience that Tiffany did feel guilt in the form of a hospital receipt or paperwork that had her paying for some of Stephanie's medical care was a lot better than the 'I made sure you were dropped, knocked out, stole your perfect life, boyfriend, and spent twenty years rubbing my victory in your comatose face' approach that they took.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a junky film, but even for these I expected better. At this rate, Stephanie falling would have been a lot better if filmed as an actual accident. Instead we get 17-18 year old Tiffany the Psychopath who only feels bad because she got blocked from her daughter's social media twenty years later, and even then she doesn't feel *that* bad cause she never tells her former classmate it was partially her fault.",netflix,Senior Year's Unresolved Issue,submission

* Have tried wiping watch histories/ratings and starting from scratch.
* Have tried entirely new accounts
* Have tried giving it over a month+ of watching multiple things daily
* I rate everything I watch
* Have tried dozens and dozens of different titles

Yet without fail, my recommendations get worse any time I watch anything.

The most recent title I watched and rated was Crazyhead (A British Zombie Comedy)

Titles that get suggested include (and this is just 1 row)

Near the end of episode 9, we learn that the bride's middle name is Flora. Then, when Jamie is having flashbacks of what the crew looked like when they were younger, we see the bride turn into Flora. But it's her middle name? 

Why would the whole family including mother and father refer to her as her middle name, and the help in the house aswell? Also she was 8, how would she know to reply to her middle name instead of her real name? We know miles' full name is miles Dominic wingrave, so why isn't he referred to as Dominic? 

Maybe she changed her name, but there is no mention of it anywhere. In just really confused. It's one of my fav shows on netflix but idk, I need this answered, I don't get it.",netflix,"Either a massive plot hole in Bly Manor, or I'm just rlly stupid.",submission

I get sometimes they are released as they are made available, but I truly despise having to wait for a week to watch the next episode. A month or more to get to the end..

I much rather have the whole season available and watch it as I can, want or feel like it

They could at least perhaps put an icon or something to show that a serie is in progress.

Yes sometimes they do put new episodes weekly but not always or sometimes they mark them incorrectly..

I guess the solution would be to wait for them but still, it pisses me off..",netflix,Episodes released weekly,submission

2386,"For those that don’t remember Netflix renewed these two shows “The Society” and “I Am Not Okay with This” but then decided to cancel both of them simultaneously. they stated that COVID was their primary reason for cancelling the shows. 

However COVID is far less of an issue now with restrictions being eased or completely lifted. 

So with that being said, shouldn’t they at the very least be considering reviving these two great shows now? After all they did promise us a season 2. Or at the very least they could give new statements and explain why they won’t be reversing their decision with COVID mostly behind us.
