Summary

**What are Wanda Maximoff and Vision doing starring in a 50's sitcom?**

**This original and remarkable series (part of Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU) stages a brilliant narrative device recreating a perfect world, a television Arcadia haunted by disturbing cracks, configuring a dialectic that perfectly accompanies the psychological evolution of his main character.**

**A new type of MCU fiction that, supported by the extended tempos offered by a series, decidedly privileges the psychology of its characters and the construction of climates over the heat of battles and special effects and that can also be enjoyed by those who they don't follow the Marvel Universe and that will surely generate in them curiosity about the previous history of their characters.**

In my opinion, **the Star Wars section** also needs a considerable rework to be more organized, consistent with its sections, and easier to understand. Why do we not have a distinction between IU and OOU content? Why isn't there a LEGO category?

I worked out an **alternative version** which I think would be way better, also in terms of the order of sections: 

**Movies**: Keep it how it is (Episode 1-9, RO, Solo), but put the movies in chronological order

**Series** (could later be split into animated and live-action series once we have enough series): Obi-Wan Kenobi | The Mandalorian | The Book of Boba Fett | The Bad Batch | The Clone Wars (including the pilot movie as a separate season) | Rebels | Resistance | Visions Star Wars in Timeline Order: Keep it how it is

**Documentaries**: Disney Gallery: The Book of Boba Fett | Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian | Empire of Dreams | The Skywalker Legacy (currently listed in the ""Extras"" section of TROS) | Galaxy's Edge - Adventure Awaits

**Shorts**: Forces of Destiny | Rebels Shorts | Star Wars Blips | Other shorts content previously released on YouTube

**LEGO Star Wars**: Lego Star Wars Holiday Special | Terrifying Tales | The New Yoda Chronicles (all as one series) | The Freemaker Adventures | The Freemaker Adventures (Shorts) | The Resistance Rises | All of the other currently missing LEGO Star Wars series and movies, availability depends on the region you're in

**Star Wars Vintage**: Keep it how it is

**Other**: Galaxy of Sounds | Vehicle Flythroughs | Biomes

I'm not a fan of the **collections for certain characters** and **Originals**, but they can be kept how they are. Disney+ should also provide a way to watch The Clone Wars in chronological order easily.

So Disney plus has finally been introduced to my country last month and I was so happy because I have this show that I have been dying to watch for ages now called soy luna.

So I download the app pay for the subscription and when I write soy luna in the search bar nothing comes up. I thought maybe they don't have any Latin American shows, but they have Bia so why not soy Luna too.

I am so disappointed and sad.

I wanna know if people from other countries (that got Disney plus last month too) don't have it as well. And if it's gonna be added soonor no . Is there like a place in the app where can I request it or something?

1872,"I love the MCU, but it can be hard to recommend specific films and TV shows to folks who are otherwise unfamiliar with the events of other films. So I've done a thought experiment to filter what I consider to be the best MCU films and the most accessible MCU films to create an ""essential"" watch order for people who want a sample plate of the greatest hits without having to get too invested in any larger lore or continuity.

Here's the watch order I've come up with.

Iron Man (2008). A quintessential Origin Story that's more concerned with being a character study than building out any elaborate mythology. A good starting point especially for folks weary of more fantastical, CGI heavy MCU films.

Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 (2017). Speaking of fantastical, CGI heavy MCU films, GotG2 is my personal favorite MCU film to date with a great balance between character driven conflict, wacky shenanigans, and a heartfelt story. 

Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). The first feature-length espionage thriller from Marvel and one of the MCU's best action films. A great showcase of more practical action sequences.

Black Panther (2018). A Shakespearean drama set in a comic book universe, and arguably a cultural phenomenon bigger than the MCU. The fact this is the only Black Panther film to properly star Chadwick Boseman as the lead makes it all the more special. 

and finally, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). A cosmic roadtrip with just the right tinge of Horror, and a welcome return to form for the long dormant Sam Rami. 

(Admittedly, the only MCU things I have yet to see are Shang-Chi, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Ms Marvel, so for all I know all three are ""Essential"".)",DisneyPlus,"What would you consider to be the most ""Essential"" MCU films and their preferred watch order?",submission

I work in web development and to me this sounds like the GroupWatch session expires in the background - seems like the default is around an hour or so. This isn't a problem with movies even if it expires in the background, because you can keep watching with the expired session as long as the content doesn't change - but with series, the episodes change, and due to expired session the GroupWatch seems to lost track who's in the group, which would explain why it'll continue showing only to the host.

1990,"Was recently watching Obi Wan on an Apple TV 4K and noticed the picture quality even in Dolby Vision wasn't as great as it normally is on Disney+. 

There was a lot of graining and artificats visible and HDR wasn't as punchy as it can be. To put it simply it looked more like some of Netflix's DV titles then AppleTV+ which has always been great.

So I decided to check bit rates and found Obi Wan streaming at 14-15mbs consistently. This is the same bit rate Netflix streams at and significantly lower than when Disney+ first launched with bit rates of 20 mbps. Apple TV+ bit rates are 25-30mbps and DV titles look stunning.

Anyone else notice this and has Disney+ reduced bit rates and PQ? Which was one of their USP against Netflix and other streamers.",DisneyPlus,Has Disney+ reduced bitrates?,submission

2084,"While most of Disney+ content is family friendly, some of it may be considered controversial to some people. I haven't watched anything that would be actually controversial to most people, but I did accidentally click on a show (just while scrolling on my phone, I didn't slide my finger far enough, so it thought I clicked on the episode, and started playing it). It was a show that my parents would certainly disagree with. While I'm an adult, I live with my parents and don't want them to know what I accidentally clicked on, because they might think I intentionally tried to watch it, and will likely yell at me if they think I watched it on purpose. They are really nosy, so it's not impossible that they would check my watch-history in my apps. And with Disney plus, that's VERY easy, as all someone needs to do is look at the ""continue watching"" section, or if they are in a list of episodes for a particular show, the progress bar shows larger then empty for shows that have been watched at least partly. For this reason Disney, I would like you to allow the clearing of watch history on an episode-by-episode level of precision. I would like to be able to make it look to outside observers like I've never watched (or even by accident clicked on) certain episodes. I would much prefer this over deleting my entire watch history, though at the moment even deleting my entire watch history isn't possible. Right now there's no way to clear any watch history at all. Even being able to wiping my entire watch history would be better for me than being unable to clear any of it, though I would certainly prefer to be able to delete the watch history of single movies or TV episodes.

Due to how strict and nosy my parents are, I may be forced to completely uninstall the app from my phone to prevent them from finding my watch history, if I can't find a way to clear (or better yet delete single portions of) the watch history in the app.

Another annoying thing is the Continue watching. Not only does it hardly ever stay up to date across devices, but not being able to edit it is such a simple oversight.
On top of all that, the main menu itself just feels awful to navigate.

Since Doctor Strange MOM started streaming yesterday, I was excited to re-watch it again in the IMAX format.

I looked for solutions everywhere and they said there is an option in the movie page to select either widescreen or IMAX format.

I used my browser in my laptop to sign into Disney Plus. I have the app in my android phone as well but that also does not have the option for IMAX Enhanced. I noticed ShangChi was in the IMAX format but it was in default like that, I did not have to select anything.

3680,"Fade in from black. Peaceful nighttime carribean quick helicopter pan from the ocean up to the beach. Transition to close up of footprints in the beach and a gentle wave splashes into it,, causing it to fade. Young jubilant laughter is heard in the distance. 

Ominous deep voice over ""They lived in absolute paradise.""

Transition to underwater view of shallow water looking up. Night silhouettes of 5 young boys can be seen floating on their backs at the surface. 

Ominous deep voice over ""But nothing lasts forever."" 

Jump scare deep boom sound is heard as a flash outline of a whale crosses left to right and leaves the screen black. 

Guatemalan jungle, bright midday, sunlight coming through the dense canopy onto a river bank. A quick gasp accompanies a close up mud covered face of a 17 year old boy. His expression is shock and fear, unaware of what just happened. His eyes dart back and forth. Transition to overhead shot from the top canopy of the five boys coming to and gathering their senses. ""Where are we?"" ""I've never been here."" ""How is that possible?"" 3 quick transition shots from far away of them walking single file through the unpaved jungle. The last is a close up of them knee deep in a dirty river wiping the thick encrusted mud off their clothes. You see their outfits are strange multicolored combinations of native, military, bandanas, and multicolored patches, stitched with bones and thread. One of the boys wears thick round old metal glasses. Full automatic gunfire can be heard in the distance as they look up to the sky. Startled birds fly overhead. Screen cuts to black. 

Fade into close up of the end of an old handheld telescoping nautical brass eye scope. Rotate to the boys crowded around the leader, perched on a high hill. Below is a crude native village. Smoke curls up from a burning cottage. Military soldiers in camouflage uniforms holding machine guns herding women and children into the crude wooden church at the center of the village. Whispers among the boys ""It must be him. Who else could bring us here?"" ""Then we find him and get back home.""

Quick shots of soldiers being eliminated one by one in different silent ways. One has his mouth covered and throat slit with a handmade knife. One has a blow dart hit him in the neck and knock him out. One bends over to inspect a round marble before stepping into a rope trap and is pulled upside down in a tree before an arrow hits him in the chest.

The camera looks from the dark interior of the church up the aisle as the boys throw open the doors, brightly lit in the doorway. Transition to bright white cloth gloves clapping. An old man's voice chuckles, ""Brava my boys! Found me as you always have. But it's not me you're looking for."" Transition to a close up of his mustache, black with specks of gray, curled at both ends into a full circle. ""It's him..."" 

Quick one second shots of other scenes of the movie show. Motorcycle chase scene between cars on the highway. Jumping out of a plane and turning back to shoot a bow at someone mid drop. The main boy holding another boys hand to keep him from falling off a waterfall. 

2 seconds of black screen, a friendly man's voice speaks over the black screen. ""I always told em Tink..."" fade to a glint of gentle green light spin around a CGI Robin Williams face. ""You can't stay lost forever."" 

Big bold words smash into the black screen.

4186,"Disney+ just launched in the Middle East over the past few hours. They decided to launch the service on a separate new app that is only available in the Middle East, and a special version of the website. 

The Middle Eastern version does not rely on user accounts but uses mobile phone numbers + OTP codes sent to them each time you login. Just like Hotstar does in India. 

Here comes the very bad part though. The Middle Eastern version seems to lack 4K, Dolby Vision and a lower bitrate unlike the Disney+ proper which is known to have one of the highest bitrates maybe just a little lower than Apple TV+. 

International users will not be able to use their accounts in the Middle East or Africa as the service shows as unavailable if you are logged in to a non Middle Eastern/African account. If you are logged in to a Middle Eastern/African account you cannot use the service outside the region either according to their FAQs.

The Middle Eastern/African version gets a new Egyptian Arabic dubbing on a majority of the content but sadly that seems to be exclusive to the regional service and won‚Äôt be marking it to Disney+ proper. 

I seriously don‚Äôt know who at Disney had the very smart idea of segregating this market when you got Asia/Pacific, Europe, North American and Latin America sharing one app and service. When every other streaming service also shares one single app including this region.
